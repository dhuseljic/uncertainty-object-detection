This is the code to reproduce the results of our paper **A Review of Uncertainty Calibration in Pretrained Object Detectors**.

## Setup
Make sure you install all requirements using `conda` and the following line of bash code:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Experiments
Default hyperparameters can be found in the `./configs/` folder.
